Project presentation for project 1 of CS 3366 Human Computer Interaction

Project Description:
  The purpose of this project is to redsign an elevator interface to be more user friendly and display more infomation on the interface.
We use elevators everyday. They have various designs for user controls but not all of them are designed at the best for users.

  * Find the issues with the current design:
      * More inofmation is available for life outside of the elevator. (Ex. weather, news, time, ect.)
      * Open/close doors button can be counter intuative.
      * Screen that is not used which is pointless from a cost perspective.
      * Lots of empty unused space.
  
  * Explain why it is good/bad:
    
    Most of these issues are very small issues where the bad does weight on the overall interface. With a bunch of empty space doesnt allow infomation to take the users attention while riding the elevator
    

B: 
  * List your most common uses and other more rare uses. Does the interface make doing those common things        easier?:

  
      Common uses:
      
           open/close door
           select floor to lift too
           call for help if elevator runs into an error
           use the bell button to call for help out side of the elevator if the call button is not working
      
       Most of the actions on the interface do allow for easy use. However, some actions such as open and      close door can require a more intensive look at the button to conclude what the action of the button is.
    
  * What is the common sequence of actions?:
  
    The most common sequence of action is first pressing which floor you would want to arrive too then pressing the close door button to procede the action of lifting at a faster than set time faster.
    
  * How does the elevator support the user to figure out how to make it work?:
      
      Support to operate the elevator is added by the button layout. Starting with 1 on the bottom and going up to 5 stack concurrently on top of each other.
      
  * How does the elevator provide feedback to the user?
  
      The buttons provide feedback to the user by flashing red when button is clicked. No other feedback is provided.
      
  * What are some common mistakes you can make with this current design?:
  
      Mistakes can be made with the arangement of the door operation buttons. The design of the button layout can allow for the activation of the incorrect button due to spacing of buttons. The user will also require more time to activate the close door feature on the interface if the user has never used an elevator. **********fix ***********
      
  * Suggest the improvements to make on the control interface. Sketch your solution:
  
  Solutions: Use plain language to help the user understand the open/close doors faster. Take up the extra space and fill with useful infomation, such as date, time, weather, news and ect.

A: 

  * Come with your design for the touch screen? What is the screen size that you want?
    I decided to go woth a 680x800px screen size to allow for easy fitment of the interface on the elevator control pannel.
