Project presentation for project 1 of CS 3366 Human Computer Interaction

Project Description:
  The purpose of this project is to give you some practice with the material in the design of everyday things.
We use elevators everyday. They have various designs for user controls but not all of them are designed at the best for users. 

C:
  * ![Interface picture](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61254256/192186289-45552119-1344-4181-91fc-ef2f98551c4a.jpg)

  * Find the issues with the current design:
      * More inofmation is available for life outside of the elevator. (Ex. weather, news, time, ect.)
      * Open/close doors button can be counter intuative.
      * Screen that is not used which is pointless from a cost perspective.
      * Lots of empty unused space.
  
  * Explain why it is good/bad:
    

B: 
  * List your most common uses and other more rare uses. Does the interface make doing those common things        easier?:
  
      Common uses:
      
           open/close door
           select floor to lift too
           call for help if elevator runs into an error
           use the bell button to call for help out side of the elevator if the call button is not working
      
       Most of the actions on the interface do allow for easy use. However, some actions such as open and      close door can require a more intensive look at the button to conclude what the action of the button is.
    
  * What is the common sequence of actions?:
  
    The most common sequence of action is first pressing which floor you would want to arrive too then pressing the close door button to procede the action of lifting at a faster than set time faster.
    
  * How does the elevator support the user to figure out how to make it work?:
      
  * How does the elevator provide feedback to the user?
  * What are some common mistakes you can make with this current design?:
  * Suggest the improvements to make on the control interface. Sketch your solution:
  
A: 
  * Come with your design for the touch screen? What is the screen size that you want?
  * Design and implement interactive features:
  * Design and implement user feedback:
  * You use Processing for this project:
